# Solar-payback-time
This project is to analyse the payback time of 300 Australian residential solar systems using the energy generation and consumption data acquired in July 2012 to June 2013. Daily, monthly and annual energy generation is compared against energy consumption. The calucated payback time in average is 8.5 years assumed smart home energy plan for the customers. The analysis reveals that payback time decreases with system size.
